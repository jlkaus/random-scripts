Random scripts that I use on my laptop and in the cloud.  All of these are pretty-much one-offs.
In particular, they do not include:
 - my music ripping and music management script system (see musikding)
 - my book logging app/webpage stuff (see booklog)

Directories in here:

books/   my book data processing scripts and old data
angular/  scripts to work with svg and html angular rulers
finance/  scripts to work with my csv files from banks, mint, etc and do analysis
youtube/  scripts to interact with youtube playlists and videos
mpr-playlists/  scripts to re-format mpr classical playlist data
slackware-changelog/ scripts to re-format the slackware changelogs
fitbit/  scripts to deal with fitbit data
