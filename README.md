This is a test file in my repository, edited from my tablet.
The keyboard is very small, and thus my net typing speed has vastly decreased, given that I have to keep going back to correct mistakes.
This is troubling, but not so horrible as I might have imagined.

Now, some test perl code:
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

if($hashref->{thinger} eq $otherref->[0]->{$ENV{HOME}}) {
  why();
  substr($_,5,6) = "test";
  }
  
  exit(0);
  
Now some test C code:
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if(test()) {
    goback();
    Why::stupid();
    int x = 5;
    Why now=new Why(BrownCow::BrownCow());
    if (now.test() == x) {
      Why::unstupid();
    }
  } else {
    printf("This is a test %d  %.10s\n", x,now.toString());
  }
  
  return 0;
}
